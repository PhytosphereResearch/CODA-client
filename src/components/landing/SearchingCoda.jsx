        The tabs in the CODA website allow you to search for the following
        information:
      </p>
      <Link to="/oaks">
        <b>Oaks</b>
      </Link>
      <p>
        Search for the description of any of the oak hosts in the database. You
        can search using the scientific name, common name, or characteristics in
        the description (e.g., evergreen). Oak images and range information are
        provided through external links.
      </p>
      <Link to="/agents">
        <b>Agents</b>
      </Link>
      <p>
        Find information about individual agents by seaching on their scientific
        names, including non-current scientific names that are included as
        synonyms in CODA. You can also search by agent common name, though many
        agents do not have common names. Agent records show the classification
        of the agent, notes, and links to agent images in CalPhotos.
      </p>
      <Link to="/hi">
        <b>Interactions</b>
      </Link>
      <p>
        Use the interactions tab to find agents that cause a given symptom
        (example photos are available) on a specified part (e.g., leaf, branch,
        trunk) of a given oak. You must specify the host oak at minimum. Modify
        your search by changing search terms. Click on the database search
        results to see a full data record showing information on the agent,
        symptoms caused on various parts of the oak, references, and other
        information.
